Converting this to the probability metric, the probability of a respondent being satisfied with mass transportation spending is approximately 0.53 (95% CI [0.51, 0.55]). This tells us that, on average, about 53% of respondents are satisfied with the current spending on mass transportation.\n\nNow let’s fit a model using the demographic factors - age,sex, sei10 - to predict the odds a person is satisfied with spending on mass transportation.

This equates to the odds of thinking the spending amount is right in females being 1.29 times the odds of thinking this in men (95% CI [1.13, 1.44]).\nThe predicted probability for females to be satisfied with spending on mass transportation is 55.9% (95% CI [53.3%, 58.5%]) and that of males is 49.5% (95% CI [46.7%, 52.4%]).\n\nVerify this.\n\nNext, consider the relationship between age and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

The odds ratio is 0.993853 (95% CI [0.9841608, 1.0036407])which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of age, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993853, or approximately 0.6146969% per unit increase in age, holding other factors constant.\n\nConsider the relationship between SES and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

The odds ratio is less than 1 (0.9937922), which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of SES index, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993, or approximately 0.7% per unit increase in SES index, holding other factors constant (95% CI [0.989, 0.998])."

Converting this to the probability metric, the probability of a respondent being satisfied with mass transportation spending is approximately 0.53 (95% CI [0.51, 0.55]). This tells us that, on average, about 53% of respondents are satisfied with the current spending on mass transportation.\n\nNow let’s fit a model using the demographic factors - age,sex, sei10 - to predict the odds a person is satisfied with spending on mass transportation. Make any necessary adjustments to the variables so the intercept will have a meaningful interpretation.

This equates to the odds of thinking the spending amount is right in females being 1.29 times the odds of thinking this in men (95% CI [1.13, 1.44]).\nThe predicted probability for females to be satisfied with spending on mass transportation is 55.9% (95% CI [53.3%, 58.5%]) and that of males is 49.5% (95% CI [46.7%, 52.4%]).\n\nVerify this.\n\nNext, consider the relationship between age and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

The odds ratio is 0.993853 (95% CI [0.9841608, 1.0036407])which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of age, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993853, or approximately 0.6146969% per unit increase in age, holding other factors constant.\n\nConsider the relationship between SES and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

The odds ratio is less than 1 (0.9937922), which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of SES index, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993, or approximately 0.7% per unit increase in SES index, holding other factors constant (95% CI [0.989, 0.998])."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe model best predicts satisfaction with mass transportation when it includes age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and political views (polviews) as predictors. Specifically, the results indicate that:\n\nConservatives tend to express greater satisfaction with mass transportation compared to liberals.\nFemales report higher satisfaction with mass transportation than males.\nIndividuals with a lower socioeconomic status are more satisfied with mass transportation than those with a higher socioeconomic status.\n\nThese findings suggest that political ideology, gender, and socioeconomic background all play a role in shaping public attitudes toward mass transportation.\n\n\n\n\nDf\nDeviance\nResid.

Converting this to the probability metric, the probability of a respondent being satisfied with mass transportation spending is approximately 0.53 (95% CI [0.51, 0.55]).

The odds ratio is 0.993853 (95% CI [0.9841608, 1.0036407])which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of age, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993853, or approximately 0.6146969% per unit increase in age, holding other factors constant.\n\nConsider the relationship between SES and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe model best predicts satisfaction with mass transportation when it includes age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and political views (polviews) as predictors. Specifically, the results indicate that:\n\nConservatives tend to express greater satisfaction with mass transportation compared to liberals.\nFemales report higher satisfaction with mass transportation than males.\nIndividuals with a lower socioeconomic status are more satisfied with mass transportation than those with a higher socioeconomic status.\n\nThese findings suggest that political ideology, gender, and socioeconomic background all play a role in shaping public attitudes toward mass transportation.\n\n\n\n\nDf\nDeviance\nResid.
